Title: Performance testing of load time.
Description: Load time was tested five times and averaged. No data was collected for the mobile version of Safari, since there is no way to view the console.
    The first number is page lode time; the second is the time until the page is operable. Both are in seconds.
Actual Results:
-	Firefox (Sprint 4): 0.32764 / 3.0188 
-   Firefox (Sprint 5): 3.7482 / 5.7482
-	Chrome (Sprint 4): 0.412904 / 2.912904

Description: Ensuring that the “Loading Assets…” screen appears with proper animation. Also, 
    this is a test to note any different aesthetics.

The names of the statistics remain in each of their box. The sidebar that contains the statistics remains on the screen when the user scrolls down the page the the "About SMAP" section. Behaves as expected.
