Title: Performance testing of load time.
Description: Load time was tested five times and averaged. No data was collected for the mobile version of Safari, since there is no way to view the console.
    The first number is page lode time; the second is the time until the page is operable. Both are in seconds.
Actual Results:
-	Firefox (Sprint 4): 0.32764 / 3.0188 ************DO THIS ONE AGAIN!!*************************
-       Firefox (Sprint 5): 1.584 / 3.584
-	Chrome (Sprint 4): 0.412904 / 2.912904
-	Chrome (Sprint 5): 1.4199300000000221 / 3.419930000000022
-	Safari (desktop) (Sprint 4): 0.2772 / 2.7772
-	Safari (desktop) (Sprint 5): 0.668 / 2.668
-	Microsoft Edge (Sprint 5): 0.8545218 / 2.854218

Title: Site loading and consistency of aesthetics.
Description: Ensuring that the “Loading Assets…” screen appears with proper animation. Also, 
    this is a test to note any different aesthetics.
Expected Result: The dots in the loading screen bounce up and down until the site itself has 
    loaded. There will be a reasonable amount of space for the empty statistic containers.
Actual Result: 
-	Firefox: When all the statistics are selected and moved from "Statistic Selection" to "Statistic Setting" it is clear that all statistics were selected. The names of the statistics remain in each of their box. The sidebar that contains the statistics remains on the screen when the user scrolls down the page the the "About SMAP" section.
-	Chrome: Same as Firefox.
-	Safari (desktop): When the “Statistic Settings” box is empty, the grey area below it is very small. Statistic boxes are not dynamic, so some of the names spill out of the box.
-	Safari (mobile): Same as desktop Safari.
-	Microsoft Edge: same as Firefox.

Title: Applying a filter to the map.
Description: A filter is added to the map by clicking on a slider.
Expected Result: The filter moves from the “Statistic Selection” box to the “Statistic Settings” 
    box. The map becomes colored, with different states as different colors. When the cursor is on a state, that state is highlighted a slightly brighter color and has a thicker border.
Actual Result: 
-	Firefox: As expected.
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
- 	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

Title: Selecting a theme color.
Description: A theme color is applied to the map, after a statistic has already been selected.
Expected Result: The user selects a theme from the menu that appears when hovering over the 
    paint roller icon. The map, sliders, slider headings, and best/worst indicator change colors.
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected.
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): Same as Chrome.
-	Safari (mobile): Same as Chrome.
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

Title: Remembering the last session.
Description: Reloading the page will not reset the sliders.
Expected Result: When the user reloads the page, the previously selected sliders will appear (and the map will be colored accordingly). In addition, the active theme should be the same theme as before. 
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected. 
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

Title: Applying multiple filters.
Description: More than one filter is applied.
Expected Result: The map colors change slightly based on the newly added statistic. The slider 
    moved from “Statistic Selection” to “Statistic Settings.” The theme color did not change.
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected.
-	Chrome: As expected
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected

Title: Defining weights when multiple filters are selected.
Description: The slider value is moved from its normal place (3) to a different value.
Expected Result: The map will update its colors, either slightly or a lot, depending on if the 
    slider was moved by one unit or multiple.
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected.
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

Title: Viewing site information.
Expected Result: Scrolling all the way down or clicking on the downward arrow shows the user a 
brief description of the SMAP website. As the site scrolls down, the sidebar with the 
    statistics is pushed to the left and eventually completely off-screen.
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected, but the statistics sidebar does not move.
-	Chrome: Same as Firefox.
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
-	Microsoft Edge: Same as Firefox.

Title: Selecting all statistics.
Description: All ten of the available statistics are selected at once.
Expected Result: The map will update colors with each statistic added, and each will be added to the “Statistic Settings” section (and removed from “Statistic Selection”).
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected. 
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): “Statistic Settings” area is not scrollable, so there are a few statistics that get pushed off-screen but can’t be clicked because the sidebar slides off-screen.
-	Safari (mobile): Same as desktop Safari, but worse because the screen is small.
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

Title: Removing all selected statistics.
Expected Result: Clicking the X on the left side of the slider updates the map color appropriately (or changes it to white if that was the only active statistic). The slider moves from “Statistic Settings” to “Statistic Selection.”
Actual Result:
-	Firefox: As expected.
-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop): As expected.
-	Safari (mobile): As expected.
- 	Microsoft Edge: As expected.

-	Chrome: As expected.
-	Safari (desktop):
-	Safari (mobile):
-	Microsoft Edge: As expected.
